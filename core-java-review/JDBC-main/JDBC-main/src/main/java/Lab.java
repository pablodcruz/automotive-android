/**
 * JDBC stands for Java DataBase Connectivity.  It is utilized to connect our java code with a database.
 * JDBC will allow us to execute SQL statements from java and retrieve the result set of that query to be utilized in java
 *
 * JDBC datatypes to know:
 *  - Connection: Creates an active connection to the database.
 *  - Statement: An object that represents a SQL statement to be executed.
 *  - ResultSet: An object that represents the virtual table return from a query (Only needed for executing DQL statements)
 *
 * Background:
 * Assume we have the following table:
 *      songs table
 *      |   id  |      title        |        artist         |
 *      -----------------------------------------------------
 *      |1      |'Let it be'        |'Beatles'              |
 *      |2      |'Hotel California' |'Eagles'               |
 *      |3      |'Kashmir'          |'Led Zeppelin'         |
 *
 * Assignment: Write JDBC logic in the methods below to achieve the following
 *                  - create a new song in our songs database table
 *                  - retrieve all songs from our database table
 *
 * If this is your first time working with JDBC, I recommend reading through the JDBCWalkthrough file that displays how to use JDBC for a similar scenario.

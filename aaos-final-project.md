# Android Automotive Group Project Outline
 
## Objective:
Develop an Android Automotive app that enhances the in-car experience while prioritizing safety and minimizing distractions.
This project outline sets a structured framework for you all to develop Android Automotive applications that are not only functional and innovative but also safe and user-friendly for drivers. The focus on documentation and presentation ensures that the teams are not only focus on coding but also on their ability to articulate and showcase their work effectively. The project is designed to encourage learning and adaptation, pushing the boundaries of what is currently possible in automotive app development.
 
## Project Requirements
 
1. **Team Composition and Collaboration**
   - Two teams 
   - Team 1 Lead: Swati
   - Team 2 lead: Anhil
   - Daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.
   - Use of collaborative tools for version control and task management (e.g., Git, Jira, and/or [Github Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/quickstart-for-projects))
 
2. **Architecture**
   - UI using XML or Jetpack
   - Document architectural decisions and flow for clarity in both development and presentation.
 
3. **Technology Stack**
   - Android Studio, UI: XML or Jetpack Compose, Java/Kotlin
   - Car Apps library, Automotive OS
   - Log Data to a local file
 
4. **Documentation**
   - Maintain comprehensive documentation throughout the development process:
     - MVP Project requirements (with optional stretch goals)
     - Daily stand-up notes to record progress and impediments.
     - Code documentation for maintainability and clarity.
 
5. **Presentation**
   - Prepare a 10 min PowerPoint presentation covering:
     - Project overview and team roles.
     - Architectural choices and their justifications.
     - Key features implemented.
     - Demonstrations of the app functionality.
     - Challenges faced and solutions implemented.
     - Future feature considerations and improvements.
 
5. **Sensor Logger**
    - **Description**: An app that tracks and logs different ADAS sensors 
    - **Features**:
        - Tracking and analysis of driving patterns like speed, acceleration, and idle times.
        - Each person handles 1 sensor (camera, Radar, GPS, Lidar)
        - (optional) Suggestions for improving driving habits to save fuel and reduce wear.
        - (optional) Gamification elements where drivers can earn badges or scores for eco-friendly driving.
 
## Final Deliverables
- **Source Code**: Complete, well-commented, and structured source code hosted on a version control platform like GitHub.
- **Technical Documentation**: Detailed documentation that includes setup instructions, architecture descriptions, and usage guides.
- **Presentation Slides**: Slides for the final presentation that visually represent the project's scope, architecture, key features, challenges faced, and potential future enhancements.
- **Team Presentation**: A demonstration of the app in action, highlighting its key features and usability within an automotive setting.
 
## Evaluation Criteria
- **Functionality**: How well does the app perform the tasks it is supposed to?
- **User Interface and Experience**: Is the app easy to use in a vehicle setting? Does it enhance the driving experience without causing distractions?
- **Creativity and Innovation**: How creative are the features and solutions implemented in the app?
- **Adherence to Safety Standards**: How well does the app meet automotive safety and distraction guidelines?
- **Technical Quality**: Quality of the code, architectural design, and overall project organization.
